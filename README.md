FRET: Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool
=============================================

Introduction
------------

FRET is a framework for the elicitation, specification, formalization and understanding of requirements. Users enter system requirements in a specialized natural language. FRET helps understanding and review of semantics by utilizing a variety of forms for each requirement: natural language description, formal mathematical logics, and diagrams. Requirements can be defined in a hierarchical fashion and can be exported in a variety of forms to be used by analysis tools.

FRET. Detailed information can be found in the [FRET manual](fret-electron/docs/_media/userManual.md).

Installation
------------

Detailed instructions can be found in [installation instructions](fret-electron/docs/_media/installingFRET/installationInstructions.md).

Platforms
---------

FRET has been tested in a range of architecture/operating system
combinations. It has been tested on PC Intel, Apple Mac and Sun
architectures, with different versions and distributions of Windows, Mac OS
X, and Linux.
