# Copilot

[Copilot](https://copilot-language.github.io/) is a high-level runtime verification framework that produces hard real time C code. Among others, Copilot has been used by the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center to monitor drone test flights.

Through our FRET-To-Copilot integration, we allow users to write requirements using the intuitive language of FRET and automatically formalize them. The formalized requirements can then be exported along with information about variables and functions in a JSON format, which can be directly digested by Copilot through the Ogma tool.
