## Copilot

[Copilot](https://copilot-language.github.io/) is a high-level runtime verification framework that produces hard real time C code. Among others, Copilot has been used by the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center to monitor drone test flights.

Through our FRET-To-Copilot integration, we allow users to write requirements using the intuitive language of FRET, automatically formalize them, and the formalizations along with information about variables and functions in a JSON format that can be directly digested by Copilot.
