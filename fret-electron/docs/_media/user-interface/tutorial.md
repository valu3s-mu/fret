# Quick Tutorial

FRET's dashboard summarizes the status of your projects and provides a hierarchical view of all the requirements, as shown below. Prior to creating any projects, the dashboard will not have anything to display and will be blank.

## Getting started

To get started, select the **Projects** menu pull down to select an existing project, or to create a new project, where your requirements belong.

## Dashboard displays
The dashboard displays all your projects and their corresponding requirements in a hierarchical fashion. Red indicates requirements that cannot be formalized, as opposed to green. You can navigate within the bubble hierarchy, and view requirements summaries by hovering over a requirement bubble. Several statistics are displayed on top of the dashboard.

Recent activity is displayed on the right hand side of the dashboard, where a warning icon exists next to requirements that are not formalized.

As soon as you select a specific project, the dashboard filters the information to your selected project. Moreover, it highlights, in the list of recently edited requirements, those requirements that belong to the selected project.

## Writing requirements

Select the **Create** button to create a new requirement. Fill in a unique requirement identifier, such as *ProjectName-ComponentName-Number*. You will be warned if that requirement ID is already in use. You can optionally specify the requirement ID of a parent requirement, and also a rationale for the requirement. Details on how to write requirements are available [here](./examples/writingReqs.md).

## Sortable table display

To view and edit the requirements in your project in a tabular form, select the _list_ button on the left of the dashboard. More information on this view is available [here](./examples/table.md)


## Exporting/Importing requirements

Export and import buttons are available for saving/exporting your requirements or importing requirements written by other users in FRET.

More information on how to export is available [here](./export&import/export.md).
More information on how to import is available [here](./export&import/import.md).
