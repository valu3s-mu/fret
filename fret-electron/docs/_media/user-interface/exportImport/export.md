# How to export a FRET project

FRET users can export and share their projects. Below we show how a FRET project can be exported in JSON or Markdown format.

Note that FRET projects consist of requirements and variables. Exporting in JSON format allows a user to pick whether to export 1) only requirements or 2) requirements and variables. Exporting in Markdown exports only requirements.

To export a FRET project, click the **upward arrow** button.
